      These beautiful bushy plants are easy to grow and look after, they look great on a bookshelf or on a kitchen window, perfect as a single plant in a small apartment or as part of a group of plants on display.
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      Plant will have one large leaf with smaller leaves around the bottom amongst the roots.
      <br>
      <br>
      Care Tips:
      peperomia requires bright indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight as this can cause the variegation on its leaves to fade.
      <br>
      plant prefers increased humidity but will tolerate normal humidity levels. Avoid dry air.
      leaves will droop and curl when thirsty.
      <br>
      Keep soil lightly moist by watering when the top 1-2 inches of potting mix has dried out.
      Likes conditions of 18-24Â°C.
      <br>
      Adding extra drainage to the potting mix will help prevent root rot (orchid bark or pumice stone works well).
