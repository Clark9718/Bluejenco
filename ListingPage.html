              Care Tips:
            <ul>
              <li>peperomia requires bright indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight as this can cause the variegation on its leaves to fade.</li>
              <br>
              <li>plant prefers increased humidity but will tolerate normal humidity levels. Avoid dry air.
              leaves will droop and curl when thirsty.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Keep soil lightly moist by watering when the top 1-2 inches of potting mix has dried out.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Adding extra drainage to the potting mix will help prevent root rot (orchid bark or pumice stone works well).</li>
