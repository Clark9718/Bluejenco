  <h2>About BleujenCo</h2>
  <div class="aboutBluejenco">    
    <p>BleujenCo started off on Esty selling propagated houseplants by Scott in Cornwall. Scott started this 
      small business' after gaining too many plants in his flat. Starting with only four listings of some 
      basic houseplants, then growing his store have have 11 plants in total, with aspirations of expanding 
      to potted plants, soil and pots. 
      <br>
      <br>
      He gained a passion for plants, particularly growing them from seed, 
      during the covid-19 pandemic (like a lot of people) and after a year or so of propagating and seed sowing, 
      he ended up acquiring a few too many, running out of places to put them. After having a baby, and having 
      to put plants in higher places to get them off the floor, he came to the conclusion that he needed to get 
      rid of some as they were just getting in the way. He gave a few away to friends and family and they were happy 
      to see the plants grow and thrive with very little work. So after a little thought an planning he started to 
      open up and Esty store.</p>
